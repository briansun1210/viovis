			<text>Hi, we are Luke Gamelin, Thai On, and Brian Sun from University of Massachusetts, Amherst. </text>
			<br/><br/>
				Let our visualizations tell you the story. A story that has been of great interest. A story that has brought a major movement to human races. A story that has brought attention to the need of understanding between people and police. 
			<br/><br/>
				Our purpose is to bring knowledge to the matter around police killing people during the year of 2013 to 2021. Here, we provide an overview, with a slight focus on the Black population in particular. We let our data speak the truth. Please keep in mind that we appreciate the job that the police have been contributing, and treasure the lives of people of every color. We keep our tone as data reporters and visualizers as professional and neutral as possible. 
			<br/><br/>
				With that being said, we, the data visualizers, hope you have a satisfactory and educational experience visiting our website.

			<p style = "font-weight: 3px; font-size: 30px;">By States/By Police Departments</p>
			<p style = "padding-top: 40px; padding-left: 250px; padding-right: 250px; text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">
				The US map itself is a heat map area for the percentage of police killings over population in each state. On the left hand side of the map, there is a stacked bar chart indicating the heat color based on the police killing as a percentage of population.<br/>

				This US map includes 4 more additional visualizations. (Note: Please choose one in the drop down menu, then hover to each state to see the data)<br/>
				• Firstly, there is a spider graph for armed vs  unarmed, and vehicle vs unclear on people being encountered.<br/>
				• Secondly, it's the bar charts for top 10 city with number of black people killed in each state.<br/>
				• Thirdly, it's the Venn Diagram for the number of Black population, Number of black people killed, and Number of police killing causes.<br/>
				• Fourthly, it's the table chart for annual police killings from each police department. (Note: Please hover on the each dot to see the table chart)
